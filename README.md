## Features
- **AI-Powered Classification**: Classifies music into genres using deep learning.
- **Fast & Easy**: Just upload an audio file, and the app will predict the genre within seconds.
- **Visualization**: Displays a pie chart showing the genre composition of the audio.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive and intuitive experience.

## Installation

To run this application locally, please follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshay-Garg-0805/Music_Genre_Classifier.git
   cd Music_Genre_Classifier
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure that you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Download the Pre-trained Model**: Place the pre-trained model Trained_model_final.h5 in the project directory.
    (Due to space limitation, model is hosted externally)  
     Download pretrained model from #https://www.mediafire.com/file/qk7uj6rg69bffm4/Trained_model_final.h5/file
4. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
5. **Upload Audio File and enjoy**

## Usage
1. **Launch the App**: Run streamlit run app.py.
2. **Choose an Option**:
- About App: Overview of the app’s purpose.
- How it Works?: Detailed guide on the app's functionality.
- Predict Music Genre: Allows you to upload an audio file for genre prediction.
3. **Upload Audio File**: Select an mp3 file and upload it to the app.
4. **Play Audio**: Listen to the uploaded audio within the app.
5. **Predict Genre**: Click on "Know Genre" to classify the audio file. The app will display a pie chart showing genre predictions.

## How It Works
**The Music Genre Classifier leverages deep learning and digital signal processing techniques to analyze audio and predict genres.**

1. **Audio Processing:**
The uploaded audio file is divided into overlapping chunks to capture various sections of the song.
2. **Feature Extraction:**
Each audio chunk is converted to a Mel Spectrogram using torchaudio.
The spectrogram is resized to a (150, 150) format to match the input dimensions expected by the model.
3. **Model Prediction**:
The pre-trained TensorFlow model classifies each chunk into a genre.
The final genre is determined based on the frequency of genre predictions across all chunks.
4. **Visualization**:
A pie chart displays the genre distribution, with the primary genre highlighted.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

Streamlit - For building the web interface.
TensorFlow - For loading and using the pre-trained model.
Torch and Torchaudio - For audio processing.
Librosa - For audio file manipulation and loading.
NumPy - For numerical computations.
Matplotlib - For visualization of the pie chart.

**For installing all dependencies use**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
